Welcome to my website. I’m Vijay, a Cloud Native Engineer from the Netherlands.

{{< /sidebyside >}}

I’m a backend engineer with 7+ years of experience in the **Finance domain**, with a focus on **banking solutions**, building secure and scalable applications using Java, Spring, and microservices. As a certified Azure Developer, I’ve led successful cloud migrations and data management projects.

In 2024, I earned the {{< newtabref  href="https://www.cncf.io/training/kubestronaut/?_sft_lf-country=nl&p=vijay-narayanan" title="CNCF Kubestronaut" >}} title — recognizing deep expertise in Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies.

Passionate about clean code, real-world problem-solving, and modern DevOps, I’m on a continuous journey of learning and sharing through this blog.
